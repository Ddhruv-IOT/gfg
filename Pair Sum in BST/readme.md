# Pair Sum in BST

Given a Binary Search Tree(BST) and a target. Check whether there's a pair of Nodes in the BST with value summing up to the target. 

Examples:

Input: root = [7, 3, 8, 2, 4, N, 9], target = 12
       
Output: True
Explanation: In the binary tree above, there are two nodes (8 and 4) that add up to 12.
Input: root = [9, 5, 10, 2, 6, N, 12], target = 23
          
Output: False
Explanation: In the binary tree above, there are no such two nodes exists that add up to 23.

Constraints:

1 ≤ Number of Nodes ≤ 105
1 ≤ target ≤ 106
